# Type-Safe PHP: Online Demo Application

A simple servlet based online demo application which shows how TSPHP is translated to PHP.
The demo application is very similar to the [client-based demo application](http://tsphp.ch/jenkins/job/TSPHP_dev/lastSuccessfulBuild/) which can be found on the build server.

Please visit the [project's website](http://tsphp.ch/) for more information on the project.
Use the project's [issue tracking system](http://tsphp.ch/jira) (JIRA) to report bugs or submit feature requests.
